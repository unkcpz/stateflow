<!-- - gflow is very heavily dependent on the proven principles form [Flow-Based
  Programming (FBP)](http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp), as invented by [John Paul Morrison](http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp).
  From Flow-based programming, gflow uses the ideas of separate network
  (workflow dependency graph) definition, named in- and out-ports,
  sub-networks/sub-workflows and bounded buffers (already available in Go's
  channels) to make writing workflows as easy as possible. -->
- This library is has been much influenced/inspired also by the
  [GoFlow](https://github.com/trustmaster/goflow) library by [Vladimir Sibirov](https://github.com/trustmaster/goflow),
  and [SciPipe](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe) library by [Samuel Lampa](https://github.com/samuell)
  and [AiiDA](http://www.aiida.net/) library by [AiiDA team](http://www.aiida.net/team/)
